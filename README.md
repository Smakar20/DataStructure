# DataStructure

#Linked list:
A linked list is a data structure which consists of a group of nodes where each node may point to some other node to form a sequence.
1. a "data" field which will store our data (string, number, etc.)
2. a "next" field which will be a reference to some other node

#Linked list vs Array:
- Arrays have better cache locality that can make them better in terms of performance.
- It is easy to insert and delete elements in Linked List.
- Random access is not allowed in a typical implementation of Linked Lists.
- The size of array has to be pre-decided, linked lists can change their size any time.
